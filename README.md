### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a backend developer who enjoys building clean, scalable, and maintainable systems. My core stack is **Java + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL**, but I’m constantly learning and adapting to new tools as projects demand.

- 🔄 I’m highly adaptable to different technologies and project needs
- 🔄 I’m currently working on becoming a **fullstack developer**, but my strongest skills are on the **backend side**  
- 📚 Currently learning **Laravel**, **Vue.js**, and **n8n** for automation  
- 🧠 Strong foundation in **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **clean code**  
- 🤝 I enjoy working in teams, sharing knowledge, and solving new problems
